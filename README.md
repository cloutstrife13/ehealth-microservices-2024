# ehealth-microservice-2024

DISCLAIMER: This project is just for fun to learn Golang.

This is an eHealth project geared towards automating the Bismark system in Germany such that the need of paper-based bureaucracy is eliminated, allowing patients to easily book appointments, order prescriptions, and manage their data.

## Prerequisite

```bash
# Install golang via Homebrew
brew install go

# Install Docker
brew cask install docker
```

## Launching microservices

```bash
docker-compose up
```
